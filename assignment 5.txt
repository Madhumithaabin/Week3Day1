5. String str3 = new String("Kutty");
		 String str4 = new String("Kutty");
		 
		 if(str3==str4) {
			 System.out.println(" Same text");
		 }
		 else
			 System.out.println("Diff text");
		 
		 System.out.println("***");


justification :

* In String, the == operator is used to comparing the reference of the given strings, depending on if they are referring to the same objects. 
* When you compare two strings using == operator, it will return true if the string variables are pointing toward the same java object. 
* Otherwise, it will return false .
* Hence when we are comparing str3,str4 using "==" it is considered as not equal based on its reference and print the below output.

OutPut :
